# 1 The BayesDiffIRT for R

The `BayesDiffIRT` provides functions to sample posterior distributions
and posterior predictive distributions of item and subject parameters of
diffusion item response theory models for responses and reaction times
Kang, De Boeck, and Ratcliff (2022) `BayesDiffIRT` also provides
functions to visualize posterior distributions of Diffusion item
response theory model parameters and construct credible intervals. Under
the hood, the package relies on NUTS sampling with STAN (Carpenter et
al. 2017). Up to know, the following diffusion item response theory
models have been implemented:

- D-diffusion model (Tuerlinckx and Boeck 2005),
- Q-diffusion model (Van Der Maas et al. 2011),
- D-diffusion model with random variability (Kang, De Boeck, and
  Ratcliff 2022),
- Q-diffusion model with random variability (Kang, De Boeck, and
  Ratcliff 2022).

The two versions of the D-diffusion model are appropriate for survey
items where persons decide whether to accept or reject an item. The two
flavours of the Q-diffusion model were designted to model ability tests.

# 2 Mathematical description of diffusion item response theory models

Diffusion item response theory combines item response theory with the
drift diffusion model of decision making. According to the drift
diffusion decision model (Stone 1960; Link and Heath 1975; Ratcliff et
al. 2016), the sensory system repeatedly generates momentary evidence
about which of two possible choice options is correct. This momentary
evidence is drawn from a Gaussian distribution and accumulated over
time. The newly acquired evidence is therefore continuously added to the
evidence collected up to that moment.The accumulation process is bounded
by an upper and a lower threshold, where each threshold represents one
of the two possible choice options. When the accumulated evidence
reaches one of the thresholds, a choice is made for the corresponding
option. The quality of information favouring one response option over
the other is reflected in the drift rate $`\delta`$, which quantifies
how quickly the accumulated evidence approaches the threshold associated
with the correct or preferred decision. The distance between the two
thresholds, $`\alpha`$, determines the amount of evidence required
before a decision is made; a larger distance means that decisions tend
to be slower because more evidence is required. The starting point
$`\beta`$ of the accumulation process reflects an a priori bias toward
one of the response options. To visualize the reaction time
distributions that follow from the drift diffusion model, interactive
tools such as the [diffusion model visualizer](https://osf.io/4en3b) are
openly available (Alexandrowicz 2020).

In diffusion item response theory models, two traditional parameters of
the drift diffusion model, boundary separation and drift rate, are
decomposed into person and item parameters (Tuerlinckx and Boeck 2005).
When person $`p`$ makes a decision about item $`i`$, the boundary
separation is given by

``` math

\alpha_{pi} = \frac{\gamma_p}{a_i},
```

where $`\gamma_p`$ represents person-specific response caution and
$`a_i`$ represents item-specific time pressure.

The D-diffusion and Q-diffusion models differ in how the drift rate is
decomposed. In the D-diffusion model (Tuerlinckx and Boeck 2005), which
is applicable to survey items, the drift rate is given by

``` math

\delta_{pi} = \theta_p - \nu_i.
```

According to the Q-diffusion model (Van Der Maas et al. 2011), which is
applicable to ability tests, the drift rate is given by

``` math

\delta_{pi} = \frac{\theta_p}{\nu_i}.
```

In both the D-diffusion and Q-diffusion models, the accumulation process
starts midway between the two response alternatives. Thus, there is no a
priori bias toward either choice alternative.

Kang, De Boeck, and Ratcliff (2022) proposed extensions that include
random trial-to-trial variability in both the starting point $`\beta`$
and the drift rate $`\delta`$. In the Q- and D-diffusion models with
random variation, the starting point $`\beta_{pij}`$ for trial $`j`$,
item $`i`$, and person $`p`$ is sampled from a uniform distribution,

``` math

\beta_{pij} \sim \mathcal{U}\left(0.5 - \frac{s_{\beta}}{2}, 0.5 + \frac{s_{\beta}}{2}\right).
```

The drift rate $`\delta_{pij}`$ for trial $`j`$, item $`i`$, and person
$`p`$ is sampled from a Gaussian distribution,

``` math

\delta_{pij} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\delta_{pi}, s_{\delta}^2\right).
```

Random variability in starting points and drift rates accounts for the
conditional dependency between accuracy and reaction times (Kang, De
Boeck, and Ratcliff 2022), but note that sampling is considerably slower
for these models.
